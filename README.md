## Odd Duck Products

I build an a site for Odd Duck Products Co that displays images of products that their employees can vote on by clicking the images. After 25 rounds of voting, it shows an option to display the final results (how many votes each image recieved). The site utilizes HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
